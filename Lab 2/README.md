# ChipWhisperer Guide

## Startup Notebook
Open Virtual Box and start up ChipWhisperer VM

Let it start up and when it displays "debian11 login" you are done in the VM interface.

Next open a browser and search "localhost:8888". When it asks for password, use "vagrant".

This will open the Jupyter notebook and you can do the ChipWhisperer labs from here.

## Setup in Jupyter

go to:
/jupyter/courses/sca101/"Lab 2_1A - Instruction Power Differences (HARDWARE).ipynb"

Follow "Creating a New Directory" instructions and run codeblock

We are now finished with this file, so go to the menubar at the top and look for Kernel. Then select the shutdown option.
(This is to prevent weird errors when running in other notebooks later)

go to:
/jupyter/courses/sca101/"Lab 2_1A - Instruction Power Differences (MAIN).ipynb"
follow the instructions provided and you should be off to the races!
