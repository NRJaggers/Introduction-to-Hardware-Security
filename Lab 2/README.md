#ChipWhisperer Guide

##Startup
Open Virtual Box and start up ChipWhisperer VM

Let it start up and when it displays "debian11 login" you are done in the VM interface.

Next open a browser and search "localhost:8888". When it asks for password, use "vagrant".

This will open the Jupyter notebook and you can do the ChipWhisperer labs from here.
